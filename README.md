# graph-representation

[**KeLP**][kelp-site]  is the Kernel-based Learning Platform developed in the [Semantic Analytics Group][sag-site] of the [University of Roma Tor Vergata][uniroma2-site] and the Qatar Computing Research Institute [QCRI][qcri-site].

This is the **KeLP** graph-representation module and it contains the graph data structures.

In particular _DirectedGraphRepresentation_ models a directed unweighted graph structure, i.e, any set of nodes and directed edges connecting them. Edges do not have any weight or label; nodes are associated with a generic structure (_StructureElement_) usually containing a discrete label (it can contain a different and richer form of information as well).
